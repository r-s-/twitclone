# Rails Tutorial

I decided to do a quick run through of Michael Hartls excellent rails tutorial after a bit of time away from rails.

This book is constantly updated and it was also a way to get quickly up to speed on practical use of basic Rails 4.0 features.

I enjoyed doing this tutorial and it was certainly worth the time.
